Should any node operator or otherwise nyzo private key holder have the desire of creating a rebuttal which purportedly conflicts with the information or its representation made available by the nyzo.org platform, and in particular but not limited to those pertaining to off-chain message signing and provisioning operations; one can use this third-party medium to create a rebuttal, and this by opening an issue and providing it with a valid signed message.
