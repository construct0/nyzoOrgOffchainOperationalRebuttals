# nyzo.org's offchain operational rebuttals medium
This repository provides any nyzo private key holder with the medium by which, by providing a signed and verifiable rebuttal, can challenge the purportedly correct operational implementation deployed and thus enforced by the nyzo.org platform. Refer to the README for more information.




// todo add reference to the in-detail article




Should any node operator or otherwise nyzo private key holder have the desire of creating a rebuttal which purportedly conflicts with the information or its representation made available by the nyzo.org platform, and in particular but not limited to those pertaining to off-chain message signing and provisioning operations; one can use this third-party medium to create a rebuttal, and this by opening an issue and providing it with a valid signed message.
